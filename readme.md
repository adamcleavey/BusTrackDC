## Building, Forking, Improving

Please feel free to download, fork, or help this app improve.

This app is built using the Cordova CLI. All CLI-produced files are in the bustrackdc folder. Main HTML, javascript, and CSS files are in the /bustrackdc/www folder.

You'll need to add your own WMATA api key to config.js in the /www/js/ directory to compile a working version. (Get a free key at http://developer.wmata.com/.)

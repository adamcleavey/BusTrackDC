This app is for you!**\r\n\r\nFind the nearest bus stops, when the next bus is arriving, and where each route will take you, all in real time thanks to WMATA's data feeds.\r\n\r\nI take the bus to work and I made this app after my favorite bus app stopped working earlier this year. I hope you find it as useful as I do!\r\n\r\nThis software is free and open source -- if you encounter any problems or bugs, or if you want to help me make this app better, go to https://github.com/j-ro/WheresTheBusDC","note":"Don't delete this file!
